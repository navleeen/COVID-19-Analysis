# COVID-19-Analysis
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the world to a standstill and affected millions of lives. Identifying patients at high risk of developing severe symptoms is crucial in managing and treating the disease. Machine learning models have shown great potential in predicting the risk of COVID-19 infection and severe outcomes. These models can take into account a variety of patient information, such as demographics, symptoms to identify high-risk individuals. In this project, we aim to build a Machine Learning model that can predict whether a COVID-19 patient is at high risk or not based on their medical history, symptoms, and status.
